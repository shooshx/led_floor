   2mm stepdown
   repeat finishing pass
1054 - save but wut 2.7 bit
   very tight fit

1055 -utab with adaptive 2.65 bit

1057 -utab, 2.65 bit
   normal hole
   some slop yet

recalibrated XY axis 801.835

1058 - utab - 2.7 bit
   removed lead in/out
   shorter tabs 2.8 height instead of 3.5
   
1059 - wall test 2.7bit
   12.34 gap
   too tight, too shallow

recalibrated X axis to 795.669

1060 - wall test 2.7 bit
   increased extrude to the normal 12.55
   increased gap to 12.50
   still too tight

1061 - wall test 2.7 bit
   icrease gap 12.65
   increase gap depth by 0.3
   too loose!

1062 - wall tes 2.7 bit
   decrease gap to 12.58
   too tight
   0.3 gap depth was too much

1063 - wall test 2.7 bit
   increase gap 12.62
   decrease depth to 0.2

1070 - first wall 2.7 bit, too 57min
   tabs seem to be ok dimesions
   gap a tiny bit too loose - not really
   bstrip way too unstable
   small holes burnout
   perimiter too deep

surfaced the bed
   too deeply
   surfacing bit isn't very good 

1073 - wall 2.7 bit
   decrease wall extrude from 12.55 to 12.3
   decrease utab depth from 6.16 to 6.12
   btn holder max stepover decreased to 1.5 ?
   bore cutting feedrate decrease from 1000 to 500

1074
   decrease gap depth wall_gap_extra from 0.2 to 0.15
   changed tab positions

1075
   bore - slightly deeper holes

1076
  light holes fix for 1075

1078 wall
  tighter path in the btn holder
  wider holes for light holder
  even slower bore feed from 500 to 250
  frame contour finish feed from 1000 to 500 to try to avoid chattering

1079 light holder with 4mm ply 2.7bit
  too short, too deep

1080 light holder 2.7 bit
  reduced length fudge by 1mm from 1.38 to 0.38
  reduced extrude from 4.0 to 3.87

1081 light holder 2.7 bit
  2 tabs in each side instead of 1

NEXT wall
  slightly tigher bstrip holes  3.7 to ???  TODO
  longer bstrip holes for 4 tabs in light holder

NEXT light holder
  a bit longer?
